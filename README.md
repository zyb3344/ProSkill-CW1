# Gray-Scott Reaction-Diffusion Simulation
# Description
develop basic documentation for building the very
impressive software developed by this company. Our target audience is the group of new
interns expected to join the company. Additionally,we are implementing a
build system and continuous integration for the repository to ensure the interns cannot break
it too badly. 
we are simulation a Gray-scott reaction and implemting 3 test for the system.
* Check that the type of the model parameters (F, k) matches that of the element type
of the u and v vectors
* Check that the variables u and v are the same size
* Check that the simulation produces the mathematically correct answer when u = 0 and
v = 0.
